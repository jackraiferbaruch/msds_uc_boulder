    "- `if`, `else`: Testing for a condition.\n",
    "- `for`: execute a loop a fixed number of times.\n",
    "- `while`: execute a loop while a condition is true.\n",
    "- `repeat`: execute an infinite loop.\n",
    "- `break`: break out of the execution of a loop.\n",
    "- `next`: skip an iteration of a loop.\n",
    "- `return`: exit a function.\n",
